## ChessQuery

ChessQuery is an exploratory data analysis python script for the final semester project for CMPT353: Computational Data Science at SFU. The goal is to analyze ELO ratings in Chess across different chess platforms (official FIDE chess tournaments, online chess websites, etc) by implementing common data science related tasks (ETL, EDA, ML, etc). All dependencies are managed by a single virtual environment, and individual python scripts are modularized into its own file, all free to run.

## Project Setup

Install virtualenv for python:

```pip install virtualenv```

Create a virtual environment:

```virtualenv venv```

Activate the virtual environment:

```source venv/bin/activate```

Install all dependencies:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Now you can run any of the python scripts! When finished, to deactivate the virtual environment:

```deactivate```
